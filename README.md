# Artemix Backend

## Note:
- If `config/secrets.js` file not work might need to create one from `config/secrets_example.js` with different userName and password
- `npm install` first and `npm start` then the backend would run on `localhost: 4000`
- If there is a connection error: check whether the IP address on [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/655b0f03fa0fe43ab04e9a62#/overview) is right and whether the server is runing

## TODO:
- Edit the schema in models if you have better idea
- If you want to test, could create a json file follow the specific schema and insert into database by `makeUpDataTest.ipynb`.
